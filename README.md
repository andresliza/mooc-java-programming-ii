# ðŸ’¬ Abstract

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm AndrÃ©s, from Spain. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the **University of Murcia**, and since I'll be studying OOP next year, I thought I could entertain myself with a course on the summer break.

I've already finished the first part and I'll not be uploading it here (for now), but I'll be documenting all my progress with the second part.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All exercises I will upload to this repo get **100% passing tests** on TMC, but I cannot assure you my solutions will be the most optimal. Considering I'm just starting 2nd year of Computer Engineering by the time I'm writing this, **most solutions could be optimized and/or refactored**. I might come back to check them, but I cannot say for sure.
